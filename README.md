### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a great variety of skills in technology, what makes me able to work in a lot of different roles. I enjoy learning new things every day, interacting with teammates to build new solutions with creativity and intelligence.

Mid-2005 I started making videos for fun, some time later I was called to work as motion graphic designer in some advertising companies. I also worked in the video post-production on some political campaigns mid-2008, then I started my own design agency in 2011, when I was able to deepen my knowledge in videos and animations.

And, obviously expand my skills to other fields such as: graphic design, branding, inbound marketing, business strategies, corporate communication, social media, UX-UI, web development, programming, business administration, business development, sales strategies, etc.
