### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**This is the just beginning** of my life as a developer. It's âœ¨ _awesome_ âœ¨ cause I always liked to programming. Since always, I was curious on how these things works, but I didn't understand it at all. And, thanks to HarvardX CS50 courses, I can say that it finally makes some sense to me. I'm just a beginner, but I'm very excited to create new things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of things!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on frontend projects (libraries, frameworks, builders, anything to create UI)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to find (or create) the perfect open source CMS built on JS/Python. The one to beat Wordpress, please!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about pyqui

- âš¡ Fun fact: I started to be interested in programming when I tried to edit Windows system's files to change its UI.
