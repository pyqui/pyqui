### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Mid-2005 I started making videos for fun, some time later I was called to work as motion graphic designer in some advertising companies. I also worked in the video post-production on some political campaigns mid-2008, then I started my own design agency in 2011, when I was able to deepen my knowledge in videos and animations, and expand my work to more areas such as: graphic design, branding, inbound marketing, business strategies, corporate communication, social media, UX-UI, web development, programming, business administration, business development, sales strategies, etc. Furthermore, I currently work with some selected companies in the internal management of marketing, design, advertising, UX-UI, programming and business consulting as well as maintaining some relationships and partnerships with companies in development.
