### Hi there 👋

**This is the just beginning** of my life as a developer. It's ✨ _awesome_ ✨ cause I always liked to programming. Since always, I was curious on how this things works, but I didn't understand it at all. And, thanks to HarvardX CS50 courses I can say it finally make some sense to me. I'm just a begginer, but I'm very excited to create new things.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a lot of things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Python
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on frontend projects (libraries, frameworks, builders, anything to create UI)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help to find (or create) the perfect open source CMS built on JS/Python, the one to beat Wordpress, please!
